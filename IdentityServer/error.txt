EndpointRoutingMiddleware matches endpoints setup by EndpointMiddleware and so must be added to the request execution pipeline before EndpointMiddleware. Please add EndpointRoutingMiddleware by calling 'IApplicationBuilder.UseRouting' inside the call to 'Configure(...)' in the application startup code.
